How to Add My Solutions?
========================

1. Clone this repository.
2. If a folder by yourname doesn't exist, create one.
3. Create a file **in your folder** for each problem. File names should have 3 digits.<br/>_Eg. File name for solution to 3rd problem is 003.rb and for 27th problem is 027.rb_.
4. If you have multiple solutions, have them as separate files with suffixes.<br/>_Eg. 003\_1.rb and 003\_2.rb_.
